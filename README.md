## Notes

I struggled with recording the content because of issues with space on my macbook, so that took up a good chunk of time. I also tried to create the github repository using the desktop version of GitHub as was instructed, which I had a hard time adjusting to. I usually use the terminal, but I was really determined to get the hang of it once I started, and I think it worked out okay
